# RENDERING THE EARTH'S ANALEMMA

If you take a photo of the sun every day at the same time in the same location, you'll see that
throughout the year its location relative to the horizon and the celestial backdrop change. 

Declination and the equation of time make up the horizontal and vertical aspects of the sun's 
figure eight path across the sky. The tilt of the Earth on its axis and the elliptical orbit it
takes around the sun.

Features:
    - Colours for the different seasons (where is the sun in winter?)
    - Looping animation for an earth year.
